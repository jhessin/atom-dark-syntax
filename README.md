# Dark Syntax theme

Install with apm:

```bash
apm install dark-syntax
```

A light-on-dark color syntax theme for Atom which adapted from Todd Werthâ€™s [original IR_Black TextMate Theme](http://toddwerth.com/2007/03/29/ir_black-the-last-textmate-theme-youll-ever-need/).

The primary change from the original theme is that selections are now more visible with a lighter gray color.
